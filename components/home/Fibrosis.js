      <p>
        Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue
        becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more
        difficult for your lungs to work properly. As pulmonary fibrosis
        worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scarring associated with pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by a
        multitude of factors. But in most cases, doctors can&apos;t pinpoint
        what&apos;s causing the problem. When a cause can&apos;t be found, the
        condition is termed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis can&apos;t be repaired, but
        medications and therapies can sometimes help ease symptoms and improve
        quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be
        appropriate.
